A Midipix distribution consists of the following:
* the native Midipix toolchain, consisting of perk, gcc, its dependencies,
  and binutils,
* musl, a lightweight, fast, simple, and free libc[1] used by Midipix,
* the Midipix runtime components that bridge the gap between the libc and the
  executive subsystems of all Windows NT-derived Windows OS starting with and
  including Windows XP, and
* a steadily increasing number of 3rd party open source packages, as expected in
  any modern POSIX-compliant \*nix environment, including GNU coreutils, shells,
  libraries such as ncurses, libressl, as well as Perl and Python.

## Build-time dependencies
* **Alpine Linux**: binutils bzip2 cmake coreutils curl findutils g++ gawk gcc git grep gzip libc-dev linux-headers lzip make musl-dev net-tools patch perl perl-xml-parser procps sed tar util-linux wget xz zip
* **Debian/-derived Linux**: binutils bzip2 clzip cmake coreutils curl findutils g++ gawk gcc git grep gzip hostname libc6-dev libxml-parser-perl lzma make patch perl procps sed tar util-linux wget xz-utils zip
* **OpenSUSE Linux**: binutils bzip2 cmake coreutils curl findutils gawk gcc gcc-c++ git grep gzip hostname linux-glibc-devel lzip make patch perl perl-XML-Parser procps sed tar util-linux wget xz zip

> N.B. Some packages (*coreutils*, *grep*, and *tar*, among others) override
Alpine's BusyBox utilities of the same name, as the latter are either non-
conformant or defective.

## Building a midipix distribution
Install the above listed build-time dependencies, clone this repository, and run the
following command line within the latter:  

```shell
./build.sh -a nt64 -b release -D minipix,zipdist -P -v
```
