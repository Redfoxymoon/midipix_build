Subject: [PATCH 2/2] move inclusion of linux headers for kd.h, soundcard.h,
 vt.h to bits
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

maintainer's note: while musl does not use the linux kernel headers,
it does provide these three sys/* headers which do nothing but include
the corresponding linux/* headers, since the sys/* versions are the
ones documented for application use (and they arguably provide
interfaces that are not linux-specific but common to other unices).
these headers should probably not be provided by libc (rather by a
separate package), but as long as they are, use the bits header
framework as an aid to out-of-tree ports of musl for non-linux systems
that want to implement them in some other way.
