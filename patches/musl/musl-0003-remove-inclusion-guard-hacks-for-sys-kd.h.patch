Subject: [PATCH 1/2] remove inclusion guard hacks for sys/kd.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

maintainer's note: at some point, probably long before linux separated
the uapi headers, it was the case, or at least I believed it was the
case, that linux/types.h was unsafe to include from userspace. thus,
the inclusion guard macro _LINUX_TYPES_H was defined in sys/kd.h to
prevent linux/kd.h from including linux/types.h (which it spuriously
includes but does not use). as far as I can tell, whatever problem
this was meant to solve does not seem to have been present for a long
time, and the hack was not done correctly anyway, so removing it is
the right thing to do.
